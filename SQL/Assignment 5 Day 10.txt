Assignment5: Craft a query using an INNER JOIN to combine 'orders' and 'customers' tables for customers in a specified region, 
and a LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.region = 'specified_region';

UNION ALL

SELECT customers.customer_name, NULL
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.region = 'specified_region' AND orders.order_id IS NULL

This query uses an INNER JOIN to combine the 'orders' and 'customers' tables for customers in the specified region, 
and a LEFT JOIN to display all customers, including those without orders. The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the results of the two queries.

The first query selects the customer name and order date for customers in the specified region who have placed orders. 
The second query selects the customer name and NULL (to indicate no order) for customers in the specified region who have not placed orders.
