Assignment 6: Utilize a subquery to find customers who have placed orders above the average order value, 
and write a UNION query to combine two SELECT statements with the same number of columns.


SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING AVG(order_value) > (
        SELECT AVG(order_value)
        FROM orders
    )
);



SELECT customer_id, customer_name, 'Customer' AS type
FROM customers
UNION
SELECT employee_id, employee_name, 'Employee' AS type
FROM employees;
