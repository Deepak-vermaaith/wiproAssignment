Assignment 2: Ensure the script checks if a specific file (e.g., myfile.txt) exists in the current directory. 
            If it exists, print "File exists", otherwise print "File not found".

bash
#!/bin/bash

filename="myfile.txt"

if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "File not found"
fi

Here's how the script works:

1. The script defines the filename to check for (myfile.txt in this case).
2. The if statement uses the [ -f "$filename" ] condition to check if the file exists.
    - -f is a test operator that checks if the file exists and is a regular file (not a directory).
    - The "$filename" is quoted to prevent issues with spaces in the filename.
3. If the file exists, the script prints "File exists".
4. If the file does not exist, the script prints "File not found".

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., check_file.sh), 
make the file executable with chmod +x check_file.sh, and 
then run it with ./check_file.sh in the directory where you want to check for the file.
