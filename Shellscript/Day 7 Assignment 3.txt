Assignment 3: Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they
              enter '0'. The script should also print whether each number is odd or even.

#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  read -p "Enter a number (0 to quit): " num
  if [ "$num" -eq 0 ]; then
    break
  fi
  if [ "$((num % 2))" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "$num is even"
  else
    echo "$num is odd"
  fi
done

Here's how the script works:

1. The script uses a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input.
2. The read command is used to read the user's input, with a prompt message.
3. If the user enters '0', the script exits the loop using the break command.
4. Otherwise, the script checks if the number is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).
5. If the number is even, it prints "$num is even".
6. If the number is odd, it prints "$num is odd".

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., odd_or_even.sh), 
make the file executable with chmod +x odd_or_even.sh, and then run it with ./odd_or_even.sh.
