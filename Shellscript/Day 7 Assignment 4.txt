Assignment 4: Create a function that takes a filename as an argument and 
             prints the number of lines in the file. Call this function 
             from your script with different filenames.


#!/bin/bash


count_lines() {
    filename="$1"
    if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
        num_lines=$(wc -l < "$filename")
        echo "Number of lines in '$filename': $num_lines"
    else
        echo "Error: File '$filename' does not exist."
    fi
}


# Call the function with different filenames
count_lines "file1.txt"
count_lines "file2.txt"
count_lines "file3.txt"
