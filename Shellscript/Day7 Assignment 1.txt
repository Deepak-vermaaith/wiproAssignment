Assignment1:count the number of files and folder present in the directory.  
if possible take the directory path from user. 

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the directory path: "
read directory

file_count=$(find "$directory" -type f | wc -l)
folder_count=$(find "$directory" -type d | wc -l)

echo "Number of files: $file_count"
echo "Number of folders: $folder_count"

Here's how the script works:

1. The script prompts the user to enter the directory path using echo and read.
2. It uses the find command to search for files and folders in the specified directory.
3. The -type f option tells find to only consider files, while -type d considers only directories.
4. The wc -l command counts the number of lines (i.e., files or folders) in the output.
5. Finally, it prints the counts using echo.

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., count_files_folders.sh), 
make the file executable with chmod +x count_files_folders.sh, and then run it with ./count_files_folders.sh.
